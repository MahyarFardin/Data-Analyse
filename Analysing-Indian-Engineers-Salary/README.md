In this project I tryed to analys and extract some information from an Indian salary dataset.


## Problems Faced
The column Salary was string but I needed integer to do operations on it so I tried to convert integer
to numeric but there was somehow a missing value which took some time for me to find it, finally I found it and I had to replace it manually.
## Walkthrough
Here I explaine my notebook file

**step 1**: Loading data and extracting


**step 2**:Preprocessing:

- replcing Salary with integers

**step 3**:Doing the analysis it self on differant parameters
